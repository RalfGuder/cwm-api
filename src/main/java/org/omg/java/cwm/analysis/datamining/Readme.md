## Data Mining
### Overview

_Data mining_ is the application of mathematical or statistical processes for the purpose
of extracting hidden knowledge from large data sets. This knowledge is subsequently
used for various purposes, including actionable business intelligence and
biotechnology research.

Data mining techniques provide descriptive information that is manifest in inherent
patterns or relations between the data. This can be achieved, for example, with
algorithms for clustering or association rules detection (link analysis).

They also uncover correlations, often due to causal relationships, between the data and
a specific target property. This information is used to make predictions about unknown
data or future behavior. Techniques generating these models are known as _supervised
learning algorithms_, and include classification and approximation algorithms.

Whereas most analysis tools support the retrospective analysis of data sets by verifying
a userâ€™s hypotheses, data mining attempts to discover trends and behaviors without the
need for guessing about possible relationships.

Data mining tools are particularly effective in the data warehouse environment,
because data warehouses offer large quantities of cleansed business data for
consumption by data mining tools. Also, the advanced query and analytical capabilities
available in most data warehouses (e.g., relational databases, OLAP servers, and
information visualization tools) can be used to great advantage by data mining tools in
their formulation of models, and in the evaluation of those models by human users.

### Organization
#### Dependencies
The Data Mining package depends on the following package:
* org.omg:CWM:ObjectModel:Core

#### Major Classes and Associations
The CWM Data Mining metamodel consists of seven conceptual areas: A core Mining
metamodel (upon which the other areas depend), and metamodels representing the data
mining subdomains of Clustering, Association Rules, Supervised, Classification,
Approximation, and Attribute Importance. Each area is represented by the metamodel
packages shown in the diagram below.

Collectively, the collection of Data Mining packages provide the necessary abstractions
to model generic representations of data mining models (i.e., mathematical models
produced or generated by the execution of data mining algorithms).

Included are representations of data mining tasks and models, as well as other entities
(such as category matrix) that are common across most data mining applications and
tools, as well as their relationships to each other and their mappings to technical
metadata.

The Mining Core package consists of common Data Mining abstractions that are
fundamental to, and reused by, the major conceptual areas. In particular, this package
contains several basic packages that are required to implement the CWM Data Mining
interfaces. It is required that at least this package and one more Data Mining package
be implemented for compliance. The packages forming the Mining Core are shown in
the next diagram.

The following subsections describe the content of each component package of the
MiningCore. This is subsequently followed by subsections describing each of the
major conceptual area packages.
