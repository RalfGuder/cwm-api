## Data Mining
### Overview

_Data mining_ is the application of mathematical or statistical processes for the purpose
of extracting hidden knowledge from large data sets. This knowledge is subsequently
used for various purposes, including actionable business intelligence and
biotechnology research.

Data mining techniques provide descriptive information that is manifest in inherent
patterns or relations between the data. This can be achieved, for example, with
algorithms for clustering or association rules detection (link analysis).

They also uncover correlations, often due to causal relationships, between the data and
a specific target property. This information is used to make predictions about unknown
data or future behavior. Techniques generating these models are known as _supervised
learning algorithms_, and include classification and approximation algorithms.

Whereas most analysis tools support the retrospective analysis of data sets by verifying
a userâ€™s hypotheses, data mining attempts to discover trends and behaviors without the
need for guessing about possible relationships.

Data mining tools are particularly effective in the data warehouse environment,
because data warehouses offer large quantities of cleansed business data for
consumption by data mining tools. Also, the advanced query and analytical capabilities
available in most data warehouses (e.g., relational databases, OLAP servers, and
information visualization tools) can be used to great advantage by data mining tools in
their formulation of models, and in the evaluation of those models by human users.
