 * UnionMembers are described as features of a Union and each represents one of 
 * the members of a Union. Note, however, that multiple case values can map to 
 * a single UnionMember. If isDefault is true, the union member is the default 
 * member. UnionMember instances are allowed to have a memberCase and be the 
 * default case.
 * 
 * <p>UnionMember instances often represent structured storage areas. A 
 * particular UnionMember may be associated with a Classifier that describes its 
 * internal structure via the StructuralFeatureType association (defined in the 
 * ObjectModel::Core package). For example, the Record::Group class, itself a 
 * Classifier, can be used as the type of a UnionMember in a manner completely 
 * analogous to how it is used to describe the type of a structured field (see 
 * the instance diagrams in the Record metamodel chapter for details).
